![Without plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cara-tm/pat_typo/master/without-plugin.png "Without plugin")

A plugin for titles where Textpattern can't improves the peculiarities of the French language that adds some enhancements in order to avoid the typographic widow effect in responsive design context:

* injects hair spaces after the opening and before the closing french quotes "guillemets";
* injects non breaking spaces arround small words;
* injects non breaking spaces before colons, exclamation points, question marks, semi colons.

The same process noticed within some online french newspaper websites.

Notice: this plugin do not correct inconsistencies but only enhances the visual result by sniffing normal spaces around some signs for some corrections.
